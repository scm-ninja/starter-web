An ecosystem is balanced when the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) parts of the ecosystem are in equilibrium. This means that the nutrients are able to cycle efficiently, and no community of organisms or natural phenomena is interrupting the flow of energy and nutrients to other parts of the ecosystem.
